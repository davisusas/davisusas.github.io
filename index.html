            <a href="https://afscme3299.org/">AFSCME 3299</a> is a labor union that represents over 25,000 of the UC Workers on the campuses and medical centers. 97% of the AFSCME workers recently voted <a href="https://afscme3299.org/strike-announcement-locations/">'yes' on strike </a>to demand fair wages, affordable healthcare, retirement with dignity, job security with no <a href="https://afscme3299.org/documents/reports/WorkingInShadows.pdf">contracting out</a>, ban the box, targeted local hire program, strengthened sexual harassment protections, increased wages for student workers, and non-collaboration with I.C.E. These workers are 85% women, immigrants and people of color. This fight is not only about economic equality, but also<a href="https://afscme3299.org/documents/reports/Pioneering-Inequality_WhitePaper.pdf"> racial and gender equality </a>. The UC has proved that they don't value their work. It's not ok to play divide and conquer with students' and workers' lives. As students we should be showing support for the people who help maintain this university. It is important to recognize that there is no UC without them. They represent, and sustain this university as much as students.

These workers are our family members, and we value their work regardless of their title. As students we have to use our academic priviledge to raise awareness and defend campus workers at all costs. <b> Want to get involved in organizing for the strike with Davis USAS? </b> Follow us and Contact us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davisusas/"> Facebook </a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davisusas/">Instagram</a>
