						<b>AFSCME 3299</b> <b></b> is a labor union that represents over <b>25,000</b> of the <b>UC Workers</b> on the campuses and medical centers. 97% of the AFSCME workers recently voted <b>‘yes’</b> on strike to demand <b>sanctuary policies, elimination of e-verify, increasing student worker minimum wage, strengthening sexual harassment protections, and no more contracting out!</b>
						These workers are over 50% Latinx and 80% are people of color. The UC has proved that they don't value their work. It’s not ok to play divide and conquer with students’ and workers’ lives. As students we should be showing support for the people who help maintain this university. It is important to recognize that there is no UC without them. They represent, and sustain this university as much as students. <b>This fight is about the rights of womxn, immigrants and black and brown folks thriving.</b>

						<b>USAS</b>(United Students Against Sweatshops) reconizes the importance of building community with these workers. These workers are our family members, and we value their work regardless of their title. As students we have to use our academic priviledge to raise awareness and defend campus workers at all costs.
